# Hooked

Habits are defined as 'behaviors done with little or no conscious thoughts'. Companies that form habits do not need to rely on expensive marketing to show up. Instead, they link their services directly to their users' daily routines and emotions. The hook model describes an experience designed to connect the user's problem to a solution frequently enough to form a habit


## Introduction

1. A trigger is the actuator of behavior - the spark plug in a motor engine. Triggers comes in two types: internal and external.
2. An action is performed after the trigger in anticipation of a reward 
3. Variable rewards is the Hook's ability to create a craving
4. Investment relies on the user to do a bit of work

## The Habit Zone

### Benefit of habits

1. Increase Customer Lifetime Value by increasing how long and how frequently a customer use a product
2. Providing pricing flexibility - as usage increased over time, so did customer's willingness to pay
3. Supercharging Growth - Frequent usage creates more opportunities to encourage people to invite their friends and share through word of mouth (brand evangelists)
4. Sharpening the competitive edge - Products that change customer routines are less susceptible to attacks from other customers

### Habit zone

A company can determine its product's habit potential by plotting 2 factors: frequency (how often the behaviour occurs) and perceive utility (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user's mind over alternative solutions)
